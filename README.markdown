## L33nk.me 
A Simple URL Shortener for everyday use

###Built in Rails 3.2 with html5, jQuery, twitter-bootstrap, simple_form, haml, and sass. 

Deployed on heroku. Also has a Cap recipe for dedicated boxes.

##Usage:
Clone and go, this is really just designed to be a simple example of how easy url shortening services work. One could easily extend the base code to do more than it currently does, ie. tie in Devise and create user accounts around the service.

##Licensing
This is open-source right? Use as you like.
